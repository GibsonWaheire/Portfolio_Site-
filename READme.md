# Phase 0 Portfolio

## Description
This is a personal portfolio website showcasing my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Since I have only learned these three technologies so far, I built this entire site using them. Although I could have created a static portfolio with plain HTML, I chose to leverage JavaScript heavily to demonstrate object/array usage, loops, conditionals, and DOM manipulation.

## Tech Stack
- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**

## Features
- **Dark/Light Theme Toggle**  
  A button switches between dark and light modes by adding/removing a CSS class on the `<body>` element.

- **Dynamic “About Me” Section**  
  JavaScript reads an object of personal information and injects the HTML for name, role, summary, and skills.

- **Dynamic Projects Grid**  
  An array of project objects is looped through to generate individual project cards (title, description, technologies, link).

- **Contact Card**  
  JavaScript builds a contact section with email, phone, and LinkedIn link based on a `contactInfo` object.

- **Responsive Layout**  
  The projects grid and header adapt to smaller screens without any external libraries.

# Phase 0 Portfolio

## Installation & Usage

1. **Clone or download** this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GibsonWaheire/phase-0-portfolio.git
Navigate into the project folder in your terminal/command prompt.

Open index.html in your browser (double-click or right-click → “Open with…”).

The site will load with the dark theme by default. Click “Toggle Theme” to switch between dark/light.

No build step or server is required—everything runs in the browser.

File Structure

phase-0-portfolio/
├─ index.html
├─ index.css
└─ index.js
index.html
Contains the empty containers (<section> elements and <nav>) that JavaScript populates at runtime.

index.css
Defines colors, layout, typography, responsive behavior, and a dark/light toggle—without using CSS variables.

index.js
Holds all data objects/arrays and functions that generate the About, Projects, Contact, and Picture sections, plus theme-toggle logic.

“About Me” Data
All personal details are stored in the aboutInfo object inside index.js.

js
Copy
Edit
const aboutInfo = {
  name: "Gibson Waheire",
  role: "Aspiring Software Developer / Front-End Enthusiast",
  summary:
    "So far I have learned the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript at Moringa School. Comfortable using the terminal and Git/GitHub to version and host projects.",
  skills: [
    "HTML5",
    "CSS3",
    "JavaScript (ES6 Basics)",
    "Git & GitHub",
    "Terminal Usage"
  ]
};
To update the “About Me” section, simply edit this object (e.g., change the name, role, summary, or add/remove items in skills).

Projects Data
Projects are stored in the projects array inside index.js. Each object has:

title

description

technologies (array)

link

Example:

.js
< >
const projects = [
  {
    title: "What to Eat Web App",
    description:
      "A simple food-recommendation app that suggests your next meal based on time of day. Built with plain HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. Hosted on GitHub Pages.",
    technologies: ["HTML", "CSS", "JavaScript"],
    link: "https://gibsonwaheire.github.io/what-to-eat-web-app/"
  },
  {
    title: "My GitHub Profile",
    description:
      "All my Phase 0 and Foundation in Software Engineering projects are here. Forked, committed, and pushed using Git from the terminal.",
    technologies: ["Git", "GitHub", "Terminal"],
    link: "https://github.com/GibsonWaheire"
  }
];
To add or remove projects, edit this array—each object will become one project card in the Projects section.

Contact Data
Contact details are stored in the contactInfo object:

js
const contactInfo = {
  email: "g.waheir00@gmail.com",
  phone: "+254726899113",
  linkedin: "https://www.linkedin.com/in/gibson-w-giteru/"
};
Edit this object to update your email, phone, or linkedin link.

Profile Picture
Place a profile image file named profile.jpg (or update the filename in index.html) into the project’s root folder. The <img> tag is generated by JavaScript inside the About section, and it displays at the top:

html

<div class="profile-pic-container">
  <img src="./profile.jpg" alt="Gibson Waheire" class="profile-pic" />
</div>
Ensure profile.jpg is the correct name and located alongside index.html, index.css, and index.js.

Why JavaScript?
Although a simple portfolio could be created entirely with plain HTML, I wanted to demonstrate my understanding of JavaScript basics:

Objects

Arrays

Loops

Conditionals

DOM APIs

Each section of this site (About, Projects, Contact, Profile Picture) is built at runtime by JavaScript, rather than hardcoded in HTML. This reinforces the core Phase 0 concepts I’ve learned so far.

Customization
Update “About Me”
Edit the aboutInfo object in index.js.

Add or Remove Projects
Modify the projects array in index.js.

Change Contact Details
Update the contactInfo object in index.js.

Replace Profile Picture
Swap out profile.jpg with your own image (maintain the same filename or update the <img> src).

Tweak Colors or Layout
Edit index.css—no CSS variables are used; all colors and styles are defined directly.
